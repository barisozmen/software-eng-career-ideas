# Most important skills

## Knowing how to solve problems
- Have grit
- Know how to google your problems
  - if not enough, know who to ask questions
- Know how to ask questions
  question content:
    - a summary of problem
    - error message
    - what did you do
    - what happened
    - any situational cases other person should know
- Know who to ask questions
- Debugging techniques
  - Binary search (use with Git versioning)
  - Rule out possibilities in mind
  - think like a scientist
- Have sense on where bugs would be hiding mostly.
- Be well literate of info/warning/error loggings. try understand coming error types (exceptions) for language.

## Adaptability to new tech
Software engineering stack is rapidly changing. Learning any tool very well would lose its value in 5-10 years. What is important is learning how to learn a new tool/tech faster. Which involves:
    - Knowing where to find resources, 
    - who to get insights from. 
    - Know how to do experiments with code, do perturbation for understand how its internals are working.
    
## Sense for where to invest next
Should know learning what would provide highest return of investment (ROI). Always prioritize your learning by that.

## Setting up workspace for maximum productivity
Learn productivity tools and how to orchestrate them together extremely well. These tools will be changing by time and are ever improving. Therefore always be searching for better productivity tools. Upgrade/change them if a change would make you more productivity. For today (2019), most important ones are:

 - Editor (Intellij, Pycharm)
    - use best editors always, affects productivity a lot
    - master code navigation (e.g. jump to function definition (command+B), jump back to previous place (command+<-))
    - master code completion (e.g. change all usages of one variable at same time (ctrl+R))
 - Code review
    - write your code, and prepare descriptions, having in mind others will read over and over
    - write for others
    - be very structured between different CRs
 - Git
    - master code versioning. you can control it over Intellij as well. very important during debugging. keep points in time, so you can return back, or do **binary search** on changes for finding bug sources. It is log faster than searching bugs one change at a time.
 - Jira
    - how to plan all work. be able to note anything coming to your mind. have a light structure
